# Project intro

Please find the intro in the `backend` branch.

# Frontend host

Frontend is hosted here:

https://comforting-puppy-923af9.netlify.app

The reason for the irrelevant site name in the link is because I used Netlify to deploy the frontend. For Netlify, the free-tier users do not get to choose the app name in the link. Instead, Netlify generates one link randomly. It did pick a pretty cute name though. :)

# Hour keeping

Link to hour keeping file (frontend and backend combined):

https://github.com/pdtbinh/cs-e4670-full-stack-project/blob/backend/hourkeeping.md

Or you can manually find the `hourkeeping.md` file in the `backend` branch.

# Frontend routes

Frontend routes:

|Route|Purpose|
|-|-|
|`/`|Home route, show all available projects|
|`/login`|Show login or register form|
|`/register`|Register new user|
